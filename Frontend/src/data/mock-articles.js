    excerpt: 'Scammers are sending fake UPI payment requests with messages like "Claim your cashback." Do not enter your PIN to receive money.',
    content: `
      <p>A new wave of UPI scams is targeting users in the Howrah area. Scammers are exploiting the "Request Money" feature on apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm.</p>
      <p><strong>How the Scam Works:</strong> You receive a payment request, often for a small amount, with a tempting message like "Click here to receive your Rs. 500 cashback" or "Confirm to get your refund." If you approve the request and enter your UPI PIN, money is <strong>debited</strong> from your account, not credited.</p>
      <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Remember: You NEVER need to enter your PIN to receive money.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>&#8226; Always read the transaction message carefully.</li>
        <li>&#8226; Decline any unexpected payment requests.</li>
        <li>&#8226; Never share your UPI PIN with anyone.</li>
      </ul>
